  "session_summary": "This session documents a comprehensive, multi-stage interaction focused on building a data extraction and analysis pipeline. The user began with a simple goal of downloading web pages and was guided through a complete workflow, including programmatic web scraping, multi-point HTML parsing, data extraction from images, and sophisticated data integration. The conversation evolved from basic scripting to advanced data wrangling, culminating in several rounds of targeted debugging to produce a final, clean, and merged dataset. The flow represents a typical project lifecycle, from initial data acquisition to final analysis-ready output.",
